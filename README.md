The goal of this project is to compare the efficacy of lesser-known programming languages to more mainstream ones.  Currently the comparison includes C, Python, Clojure, Haskell, and Factor.  I welcome advice on better ways to implement these programs, as well as entries in other languages.

This is my senior research project for my computer science major at Taylor University.

The code is all released under the MIT license.  See the LICENSE file for the full text of the license.  Open source forever!

All of the Farkle game implementations are in the programs/ directory.  The Makefile is for the C program.  Some programs also have unit tests.  Run the analysis.py program to get descriptive statistics on the programs.

As you might have guessed, the paper is in the paper/ directory.  The languages.pdf file is the first semester's paper, and the languages2.pdf file is the final paper.

The notes/ directory contains all of the notes I have taken as I did the research.  The activitylog.txt file contains the record of the hours I have put in.  Semester one totaled 119 hours and semester two totaled 130 hours for a total of 249 hours.
