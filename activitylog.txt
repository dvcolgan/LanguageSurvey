Read chapters 1-3 of the book Pro Git to make sure I understand how Git works.  These three chapters are all I will really need for this project, and they covered the basic operations, branching and merging, and rebasing.  I feel much better about using Git now.

Working on the Farkle implementation in Clojure.

Wednesday November 3
7:15 - 8:15 am
Working on the Farkle implementation in Clojure.  Unit testing is a lot easier in this language.
Document changes now instead of all at the end.

Sunday November 7
8:00 - 9:30
Working on the Farkle GA in Clojure.  It looks like all I will have to do to be able to parallelize it is to run it with pmap instead of map.

Monday November 8
8:00 - 9:30
Making great progress on the GA system.  The code looks like it will be a LOT shorter.

Wednesday November 10
5:00 - 6:30

12-1 PM
Fought with the tools, couldn't get protocols to work.

Finally figured out that I had misnamed something which was causing the real problem before!  Psh.
Protocols will work beautifully for the different players.
Wow this code is short.  Things that would take several lines and many minutes to write are 3 function calls composed.
(zipmap players (repeat 0)) -> initialize scores to 0
Stackoverflow.com is an amazing resource
http://java.ociweb.com/mark/clojure/article.html
clojure book
clojure.org docs

12:00-1:30
More fighting with Clojure.  I'm starting to get really annoyed at the Java cruft that Clojure has associated with it.
