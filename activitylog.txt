Working on the Farkle implementation in Clojure.  Unit testing is a lot easier in this language.
Document changes now instead of all at the end.

Sunday November 7
8:00 - 9:30
Working on the Farkle GA in Clojure.  It looks like all I will have to do to be able to parallelize it is to run it with pmap instead of map.

Monday November 8
8:00 - 9:30
Making great progress on the GA system.  The code looks like it will be a LOT shorter.

4:00

Week 12

Thursday November 18
12-1 PM
Fought with the tools, couldn't get protocols to work.

Saturday November 20
10:30 - 12:45
Finally figured out that I had misnamed something which was causing the real problem before!  Psh.
Protocols will work beautifully for the different players.
Wow this code is short.  Things that would take several lines and many minutes to write are 3 function calls composed.
(zipmap players (repeat 0)) -> initialize scores to 0
Stackoverflow.com is an amazing resource
http://java.ociweb.com/mark/clojure/article.html
clojure book
clojure.org docs

Almost have the human-controlled game working.

Week 13

Wednesday November 24
8:15 - 9:15
Bug hunting and fighting with the system.  It seems that Emacs with slime does not necessarily like Clojure yet to some degree.

12:00-1:30PM
More fighting with Clojure.  I'm starting to get really annoyed at the Java cruft that Clojure has associated with it.

Thursday November 25
9:00 - 10:30AM
Spend an hour finding a stupid bug that was my fault.  Doing (func coll) is not the same as (func [coll]).

11:00 - 1:00PM
Finally finished the human interface to the farkle game.  Now on to the GA.

7:15 - 9:15
Clojure is harder to debug using my usual method of lots of print statements, at least doing it the usual way.
The dynamic nature of the programs are sometimes a problem if i have a terse little function and somewhere inside it there is an error because something is now returning a scalar instead of a vector.

I am definitely thinking of new ways of doing things doing this problem again in a new language and a new paradigm.

I noticed myself blaming problems on the newness of the language, when it actually was my own fault.

Sunday November 28

12:30 - 1:30
Reorganizing the code, fighting with namespaces.

Wednesday December 1

8:30 - 10:30AM
