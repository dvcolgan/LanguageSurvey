Wow this code is short.  Things that would take several lines and many minutes to write are 3 function calls composed.
(zipmap players (repeat 0)) -> initialize scores to 0
Stackoverflow.com is an amazing resource
http://java.ociweb.com/mark/clojure/article.html

More fighting with Clojure.  I'm starting to get really annoyed at the Java cruft that Clojure has associated with it.

Thursday November 25
9:00 - 10:30AM
Spend an hour finding a stupid bug that was my fault.  Doing (func coll) is not the same as (func [coll]).

11:00 - 1:00PM
Finally finished the human interface to the farkle game.  Now on to the GA.

7:15 - 9:15
Clojure is harder to debug using my usual method of lots of print statements, at least doing it the usual way.
The dynamic nature of the programs are sometimes a problem if i have a terse little function and somewhere inside it there is an error because something is now returning a scalar instead of a vector.

I am definitely thinking of new ways of doing things doing this problem again in a new language and a new paradigm.

I noticed myself blaming problems on the newness of the language, when it actually was my own fault.

Sunday November 28
