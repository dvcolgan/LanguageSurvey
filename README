The goal of this project is to compare the efficacy of lesser-known programming languages to more mainstream ones.  Currently the comparison includes C, Python, Clojure, Haskell, and Factor.  I welcome advice on better ways to implement these programs, as well as entries in other languages.

This is my senior research project for my computer science major at Taylor University.
