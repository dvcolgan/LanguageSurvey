<p>So the question that I sought to answer was "Should these other languages be considered for new projects in industry?"</p>
<p>My area of interest, you might say, in computer science, is figuring out how we can deliver software in less time with fewer bugs.<br />
</p>
<p>I am always finding new languages that promise less code for the same functionality, with fewer bugs.  I thought that this research project would be an excellent time to investigate these claims.</p>
<p>Paul Graham, one of those famous people in the field, has long thought that fewer lines of code is better because you can't have bugs in code that doesn't exist.  So the fewer lines, the fewer bugs.  So conciseness is power.  Does that hold true?</p>
<p>My findings are that it does to an extent.</p>
<p>Never got around to Java because I was putting it off due to bad experiences with it in the past.  That would be something else to do in the future.</p>
<h1>An Investigation of Lesser Known Programming Languages</h1>
<h2>Senior Research of David Colgan</h2>
<h2>Taylor University</h2>
<h1>Background - I like programming languages</h1>
<h1>Method - Sitting at the table one night and Farkle!</h1>
<h2>Others in the past have done comparisons by writinng the same program in many different languages and comparing</h2>
<h2>I wrote the same program of Farkle in 5 different languages</h2>
<h1>Meet the languages</h1>
<h2>C, Python, Clojure, Haskell, Factor</h2>
<p>In order of how likely you are to have heard of them.</p>
<h2>A graph of programmer mood while programming in these.</h2>
<p>C - meh
Python - hmm
Clojure - mmmm
Haskell - aaah
Factor - AAAh</p>
<p>Key takeaway: learning a new language is easy, learning a new paradigm is hard.
The functional paradigm is becoming more and more important, and perhaps at Taylor we should teach it earlier and more thoroughly.</p>
<p>Some of these advanced languages </p>
<h1>Weird and cool things about certain ones:</h1>
<h2>Clojure and Haskell are Lazy</h2>
