remove file from staging area but do not delete the file:
git rm --cached readme.txt

fetch to get changes but not merge, pull to fetch and merge

fast forward means you merged a branch with something that had no changes, so no conflicts happened

rebasing is cleaning up the merge history so that it looks like there was only a linear tree of commits
