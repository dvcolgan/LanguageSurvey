lots of overhead managing memory
dealing with pointers is tricky sometimes
you have to write your own control structures in C - all of those edge cases are abstracted away, the same thing happened a lot in VB

so, i want the power of haskell with the easy object orientedness of python and not purely functional - what about scala?
returning multiple values - it is easier in C to just use globals
in python it is so easy to return two values, here i have to build up a complicated array
string handling is hard so i avoid it if possible
C is not DRY, have to declare and define functions in two different locations

C is optimized for the computer to be happy, other languages are to make the programmer happy?

we need complicated looping constructs just to do simple things
one of the most repeated pieces of code through the c program is for (i=0; i<6; i++){

in C it is not immediately obvious what you are doing just based on the code - you have to comment more?
